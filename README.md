Summary:
I validated the analysis of a previously published ELISA dataset containing standard and sample absorbance values. The dataset included a pre-calculated 4-parameter logistic (4PL) standard curve in Excel. Using MATLAB, I imported the same dataset and implemented a 4PL curve-fitting workflow. The interpolated concentrations from MATLAB were consistent with the original Excel 4PL curve, confirming the accuracy of the MATLAB implementation. Since Dilution factor was not mentioned, the excel sheet is Interpolated concentrations only, the Final concentration would be Dilution Factor multiplied by Interpolated Concentration
