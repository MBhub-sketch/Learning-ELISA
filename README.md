Summary:
I validated the analysis of a previously published ELISA dataset containing standard and sample absorbance values. The dataset included a pre-calculated 4-parameter logistic (4PL) standard curve in Excel. Using MATLAB, I imported the same dataset and implemented a 4PL curve-fitting workflow. The interpolated concentrations from MATLAB were consistent with the original Excel 4PL curve, confirming the accuracy of the MATLAB implementation.
